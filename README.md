Video tutorial : 

In this project we are going to Interface the DS18B20 Temperature Sensor with Arduino UNO and ESP8266.

The DS18B20 is a temperature sensor like DHT11 but it is more robust and accurate in comparison to DHT11.It also covers a larger temperature range in comparison to the DHT11 sensor.

So.in this project we will first interface this Sensor with Arduino UNO and display its temperature reading on the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE and after that we will connect this sensor with ESP8266 and after that we will dislay the temperature sensed on a beautiful web server.
